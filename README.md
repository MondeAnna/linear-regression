# Installation Guide

### Assumption

The following assumes that you are using a Unix Command Line Interface. That is, Linux and MacOS are perfectly fine with their default terminals, yet windows is best served with the use of [git-bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

<br />

### Package Installation

**NOTE:** The given examples use `pip` installer, though the same can be achieve with any virtual environment manager of your choice.

- Clone code to local machine
- Switch to `dev` branch
- Create virtual environment:
```python3 -m venv venv --upgrade-deps```
- Activate virtual environment:
```. venv/bin/activate```
- Install project as a package:
```pip install .```

<br />

### Running the Project

- Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```jupyter notebook```
- Navigate to `./src/notebooks`
- Open `oop_for_data_science.ipynb`
